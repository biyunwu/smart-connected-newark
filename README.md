## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into the project directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd smart-connected-newark/
    npm run develop
    ```

2.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    The site is now running at http://localhost:8000 .

    Edit `.js` files in `src/pages/` to see the update in real-time.


3.  **Build production bundle**

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

4.  **Serve production bundle**
    
    ```shell
    npm run serve
    ```
    
    The site is now running at http://localhost:9000 .


5.  **Deploy production bundle**
    
    Upload all files in `public/` to the designated directory on the server.


6.  **Delete dev cache and production files**

    ```shell
    npm run clean
    ```

## ðŸ“‚ File structure
    
- `src/`:
    * `components/` contains all components that are used by pages.
    * `data/` stores most of the contents that are rendered by pages.
    * `images/` is a folder of images that are fetched dynamically in building time.
    * `material_style/` has the foundational styling files for this project.
    * `pages/` has `.js` files whose names are identical to the path names of the website. For example, `index.js` corresponds to the homepage `https://smartcities.rutgers.edu` and `impacts.js` corresponds to the page `https://smartcities.rutgers.edu/impacts`.

- `static/`: static assets that are [outside of the module system](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/images-and-media/static-folder/).
