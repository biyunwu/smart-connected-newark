                detail: `
The theory and models we proposed have potential impacts beyond smart city service conflict management to address the fundamental systems-of-systems challenge in multi-stakeholder open environments where
* each uncertain interaction (e.g., conflicts) between systems can be modeled as a task;
* the detection/resolution process of one interaction improves the process of other correlated interactions.

Thus, its potential impacts go beyond smart city services for use cases with a generic setting of systems-of-systems with uncertain conflicts such as
* Smart rural communities
* Transportation systems
* Power grids  
* Agriculture
* Healthcare
