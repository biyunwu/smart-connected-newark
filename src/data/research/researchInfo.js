        title: `Proposed Conflict Management Theory`,
        content: `We propose five tasks to develop our conflict management theory by integrating social and technological sciences. The interactions of these five tasks are given in steps 1-5 below with three kinds of stakeholders, i.e., **Average Citizens, City Operators, and Service Providers**.
        
1. Service providers submit requests for city resources to city operators at Operation Center (OC), which runs a **Conflict** Detection module (Research Task T2) based on a **Conflict Specification** tool (Research Task T1) under city requirements;
2. If a conflict was detected, **OC** will run a **Conflict Resolution** module (Research Task T3) to study various tradeoffs to approve or reject the requests creating this conflict;
3. Approved requests will be acted upon city resources to update city states;
4. Rejected requests will be sent back to providers possibly with suggestions;
5. Based on updated city states and resolution decisions, all providers will utilize a local conflict prevention module (Research Task T4) to submit new requests to minimize future conflicts.

Finally, we propose a **Social Intervention** (Research Task T5) module to empower all stakeholders during the process.
